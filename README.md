# JS-Advanced2021
Problems and solutions from js-advanced and js-application courses in SoftUni. All of the .css and .html files was given to us, so this is not my work. 
In this course we study how to use HTTP requests, how to create Single Page RESTful applications, Baas, Templating and Routing and etc.
If you want to run application and use all features you have to download local server from given files and run it via cmd (type 'node server.js');
Thanks
